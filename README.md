The script will:
1. Connect to your Telegram account
2. Fetch messages from the specified channel and message range
3. Add each audio file to your profile's music section
4. Show progress with emoji indicators (‚úÖ for success, ‚ö†Ô∏è for skipped)

## Important Notes

- Make sure the channel is accessible to your account
- Only messages with audio files will be processed
- Respect Telegram's limits and use appropriate delays
- The script skips non-audio messages automatically
- Your session string is stored in config.yml - keep this file secure

## Troubleshooting

- If you get "Cannot generate session automatically" error, run the script from command line (not IPython/Jupyter)
- For "Chat not found" errors, verify the Chat ID and your access permissions
- If messages are skipped, check if they contain audio files
- For login issues, verify your API credentials and 2FA password
